# "The Gooch Collector"

Inspired by and thanks to work from John Mannon's [video](https://youtu.be/0aFbCtHpq3U),
titled "The Gooch Collector - clean version"; I was able to transcribe "The
Gooch Collector" song by The Greatest Technician That's Ever Lived (a.k.a. Andy,
the owner of [Salem Techsperts](https://salemtechsperts.com/)).

(I edited the original closed captions to have sentence caps and verse form.)

The [lyrics](https://genius.com/The-greatest-technician-thats-ever-lived-the-gooch-collector-lyrics)
are up on Genius.

These are official sources for the song:

## Background info

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB_OEHCsUhU) titled "Why Do People Pay
Me to Save Their Old Tech?" was uploaded on August 4, 2024.  This was the first
video that lead to official sources to listen to the song "The Gooch Collector"
in its entirety, through the video description.  Previously, excerpts of the
song were used in videos.

Personally, I was going to ask if the song was ever going to be uploaded
(dreaming for Bandcamp), but I didn't know where to start.  Walk-ins are by
appointment only and I didn't want to send unnecessary e-mails through the
customer contact form on its website.

Judging from the song's metadata on Apple Music, the song was submitted onto
music streaming platforms on July 28, 2024.  So, the circumstantial evidence
seems to suggest that the rather quiet announcement was preplaned for the video
upload on August 4, 2024.

YouTuber Chase Fournier tried to reball the [eMMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMediaCard#eMMC)
chip in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nxuKCIJc5Q) from June 2024,
which is from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MkmLH-uOwI) (in April
2024), where the Hisense TV of Andy's father broke from the defective eMMC chip.

Also, since Andy's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAIypDVt9AE) inspired
me to be confident enough to repaste my own laptops (and also helped me realize
paste doesn't go on the PCH die of the X1 Carbon Gen 6), I think this is the
least I could do for Andy.  I'll remember Salem Techsperts if I need outside
computer repair (and I strive to keep my computers cleaner than the ones that
need cleaning from the channel).

## Note

I voluntarily transcribed "The Gooch Collector" on my own and was not
compensated or rewarded in any way.
