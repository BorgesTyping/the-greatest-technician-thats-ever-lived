[Refrain]
I'm the Gooch Collector, bitch!
(You know what it is.)

[Verse 1]
Scrubbin' dust with a brush
that I stole from your kids.
Ask your mom about my rizz,
Ask your wife about her boyfriend.
I'm the greatest in this biz,
Enough dust to cover Portland.

[Refrain]
I'm the Gooch Collector, bitch!

[Verse 2]
I'm the Gooch Collector, bitch!  
Bitch!  (Bitch!)
(Blowin' dust is a must.)
Make your tech clean,
then run it over with a bus, fuck!  (Fuck!)

Got fingers like a raccoon.
Hear a noise at night,
It's just me in your bathroom.

[Refrain]
I'm the Gooch Collector, bitch!
(You know what it is.)

[Bridge]
(I'm the greatest in the service[?].)

[Verse 3]
Whip a Benz and a G
That cost less than your Camry.
Buried in the gooch,
The last guy that tried to scam me.
(I killed 'em.)

Brush as long as my dong.
Gooch so good,
I had to make a fuckin' song.
(That's wrong!)

Salem Tech is where to find me,
Catch me outside
Knuckle deep gettin' grimey.

[Refrain]
I'm the Gooch Collector, bitch.
(You know what it is.)
